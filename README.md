# face-mood-recognition
This emotion reconition tool is not developed by me, it's from https://github.com/omar178/Emotion-recognition. 
For further infomation, please refer to original repo.

The major difference between this repo and https://github.com/omar178/Emotion-recognition is that I removed real-time video camera interaction and only output emotion keywords.
