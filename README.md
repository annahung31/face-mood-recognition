This emotion reconition tool is not developed by me, it's from https://github.com/omar178/Emotion-recognition. 
For further infomation, please refer to original repo.

The major difference between this repo and the [original one](https://github.com/omar178/Emotion-recognition) is that I output emotion keywords instead of real-time camera frames.
